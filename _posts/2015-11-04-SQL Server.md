**Difference between Abstract and Interface**

**Abstract Class:**

-Abstract class provides a set of rules to implement next class
-Rules will be provided through abstract methods
-Abstract method does not contain any definition
-While inheriting abstract class all abstract methods must be override
-If a class contains at least one abstract method then it must be declared as an "Abstract Class"
-Abstract classes cannot be instantiated (i.e. we cannot create objects), but a reference can be created
-Reference depends on child class object's memory
-Abstract classes are also called as "Partial abstract classes"
-Partial abstract class may contain functions with body and functions without body
-If a class contains all functions without body then it is called as "Fully Abstract Class" (Interface)

**Interface:**

-If a class contains all abstract methods then that class is known as "Interface"
-Interfaces support like multiple inheritance
-In interface all methods r public abstract by default
-Interfaces r implementable
-Interfaces can be instantiated, but a reference cannot be created
